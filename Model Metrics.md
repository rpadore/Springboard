# Model Metrics File

I have chosen a randomforest regressor as my model choice for this project 

Here is the attached parameters
RandomForestRegressor(bootstrap=True, ccp_alpha=0.0, criterion='mse',
                      max_depth=10, max_features='auto', max_leaf_nodes=None,
                      max_samples=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0,
                      min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1,
                      min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,
                      n_estimators=20, n_jobs=None, oob_score=False,
                      random_state=None, verbose=0, warm_start=False)

The randomforest regressor model also provided us with a very high rsquared value of 0.991758420741848, a MSE of 0.01235097215788602 and a RMSE of 0.00617548607894301.
